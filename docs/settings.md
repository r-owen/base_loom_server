# Settings

This panel offers a few settings that you can change which apply to all weaving patterns.
Settings are automatically saved, and should survive rebooting the loom server.

These include:

* **Loom name**: the name of the loom, as it appears in the display.

* **Direction control**: specifies how to change direction (weaving or unweaving, threading or unthreading).
  See [Weave Direction](weaving.md#weave-direction) for more information.
  This setting is not shown for SÃ©guin looms and others that support changing direction from both software and a button on the loom.

* **Threading**: Specify whether you prefer to thread right-to-left or left-to-right, and front-to-back or back-to-front.
  Specifying front-to-back simply changes the threading display to appear as if you are sitting behind the castle: shaft 1 is displayed on the left and shaft 1 on the top.

* **Default threading group size**: specify the default threading group size.
  This setting only applies when you load pattern files.
  It has no effect on the pattern files you have already loaded
  (because threading group size is saved with each pattern file).
