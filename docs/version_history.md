# Version History

## 0.17.0 2025-04-27

Do this by purging the read buffer.


## 0.16.0 2025-04-25

Display total picks in Weaving and total ends in Threading.
Also jump to total picks in Weaving and total ends in Threading.

## 0.15.0 2025-04-19

Save threading group size with each pattern.

**Warning**: the database for this version is not compatible with older versions, so run the software with `--reset-db` if you have an older database.

Add a version history to the documentation.

## 0.14.0 2025-04-18

Display improvements:

* Avoid scroll bars, if possible.
* Make font size vary somewhat with window size.
* Avoid the search bar and tab controls at the bottom of the iPhone.
* In Threading move Group size to the right of Direction, to save space.

## 0.13.0 2025-04-18

Display improvements:

* Resize the weaving and threading pattern display to fill available space.
* Move the direction control and (for weaving) pick color, for easier access.

## 0.12.1 2025-04-14

Small display improvements.

## 0.12.0 2025-04-03

Support WeavePoint .wpo files.

Improve the display of white threads.

## 0.11.0 2025-04-02

Add a preliminary Finnish translation.

Fix a few issues with the installation instructions (especially those related to finding the loom's USB port on unix and macOS).

Thanks to Kalle Pihlajasaari for the translation and the doc bug reports.

## 0.10.0 2025-03-18

Add a `Separate repeats` checkbox to Weaving and Threading to control whether to include a separator pick (all shafts down) between repeats of weaving or threading.
  
The weaving and threading values are independent of each other, and are saved per pattern in the database.

The intial value for weaving/threading is "on" if the number of picks/ends > 20, else "off".
The idea being that the extra advance is helpful for long sequenced, but annoying for short sequences.

**Warning**: the database for this version is not compatible with older versions, so run the software with `--reset-db` if you have an older database.

Display loom name and # shafts.
