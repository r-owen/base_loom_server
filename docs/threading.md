# Threading

The threading mode helps you correctly thread warp strings through the heddles.
Every time you press the pedal, the loom will raise the next group of shafts
and a display will show you which threads belong on which shaft.

This page assumes you have done all the [basics](index.md):

* Connected your web browser to the loom server
* Uploaded at least one pattern, and selected a pattern from the pattern menu
* Selected the Threading mode.

## Threading Display

Threading is displayed as a picture that shows a group of threads (vertical colored bars) and the shaft they go through (numbers that interrupt the colored bars).
It also shows the one or a few warp thread numbers along the top.

Warp end numbering goes up from 1 at the right (the typical US scheme when warping back to front).
Warp end 0 is special: it has no shafts and no warp thread. It is the first pick when starting to thread a pattern.
It is also an intermediate step when repeating a threading sequence, unless "Separate repeats" is unchecked.

## Threading Direction

The square button labeled "Direction" shows and changes the direction you are threading: a left-facing arrow indicates that you are threading right to left. Press the button to change the threading direction.

**Warning** the dobby's direction control button (e.g. REVERSE or UNW) is always ignored while threading.

## Jumping

You can jump to a different warp end and/or repeat number.
The end number you specify is be the smaller warp end number,
e.g. if group size is 4 and you jump to 21, the displayed group will be ends 21, 22, 23, 24, and 25
(or fewer, if the warp has fewer than 25 threads).

Jumping is a two-step process: first you request the jump, then you advance to it by pressing the loom's pedal.
(Two steps are necessary because most looms will not accept an unsolicited command to raise shafts.)
In detail:

* Enter the desired warp end and/or repeat numbers in the boxes on the "Jump to end" line.
    The box(es) will turn pink and the Jump button will be enabled.

* Press the "return" keyboard key or click the "Jump" button on the web page
    to send the requested jump to the server.
    You will see several changes:

    * The jump input boxes will have a white background and the jump button will be disabled.

    * The pattern display will show the new thread group, with a dotted box around it.
    (But if you are only changing the repeat number, the box will be solid.)

* Advance to the next group by pressing the loom's pedal.
    Until you advance to the next group, you can request a different jump
    (in case you got it wrong the first time) or cancel the jump in several ways:

    * Press the "Reset" button to the right of "Jump".

    * Reload the page.

    * Select a new pattern.

## Group Size

The "Group size" menu selects how many warp ends are in a group, All shafts for a group are raised at once.

You can change the group size whenever you like; the change takes effect for the next thread group (next time you push the pedal to advance).

## Repeating

The software will automatically repeat threading if you thread beyond the end.
However, like [Weaving](weaving.md), the transition depends on the `Separate repeats` checkbox:

* "On" (checked): you must advance twice when you reach an end, before the next set of shafts is raised.
  The first advance will lower all shafts, as a signal that you have finished threading or unthreading one pattern repeat. That is the "separator".

* "Off" (unchecked): there is no indication that you have reached the end of threading.
  The next advance will start the next repeat of threading or unthreading.

The default value of `Separate repeats` is "on" if the pattern has more than 20 warp threads, "off" otherwise.
The idea behind this is that frequent separator picks are annoying for short threading sequences, but having a separator pick is useful for long sequences.

Note that the value of the Weaving and Threading `Separate repeats` checkboxes are independent of each other,
and may also be different for different patterns. They are saved in the pattern database.
