# Weaving

How to weave fabric.

This page assumes you have done all the [basics](index.md):

* Connected your web browser to the loom server
* Uploaded at least one pattern, and selected a pattern from the pattern menu
* Selected the Weaving mode.

## Pattern Display

The pattern is displayed as a picture that shows woven fabric below and potential future fabric above.
(This is the opposite of the usual US drawdown).
Note that the display is a bit naive, in that it shows all threads as the same thickness
and does not display multi-layer patterns (such as doubleweave) correctly.

## Weave Direction

The square button labeled Direction shows the weave direction: a green down arrow if you are weaving, a red up-arrow if you are unweaving.
  The arrow points in the direction cloth is moving through the loom.

  How you change direction depends on the loom:

  * SÃ©guin looms allow you to change direction by pressing the square
    weave direction button or pressing the UNW button on the dobby unit.
    Both work. Use whichever you prefer.

  * Toika looms can be operated in one of two ways, specified by
    a command-line argument when you start the loom server:

      * Software controls the weave direction. The square button showing weave
        direction can be pressed to change the direction. <b>The physical REVERSE button
        on the dobby head is ignored</b>. This is the default.

      * The loom controls the weave direction. You have to press the physical REVERSE button
        on the dobby head to change direction. The square button showing weave direction
        is only a display (you can't click it). You run in this mode by starting the loom server with argument `--weave-direction loom`.
  
  * For other looms, see the loom-specific documentation with the software package.

## Pick Color

The long colored rectangle to the right the Pick row shows the color of the current pick (blank for pick 0),
or, if you have specified a pick to jump to, then it is the color of that pending pick.

## Jumping

You can jump to a different pick.

Jumping is a two-step process: first you request the jump, then you advance to it by pressing the loom's pedal.
(Two steps are necessary because most looms will not accept an unsolicited command to raise shafts.)
In detail:

* Enter the desired pick in the box on the "Jump to pick" line.
  The box will turn pink and the Jump button will be enabled.

* Press the "return" keyboard key or click the "Jump" button on the web page to send the requested jump to the server.
  You will see several changes:

    * The jump input box will have a white background and the jump button will be disabled.

    * The pattern display will show the new pick in the center row, with a dotted box around it.

* Advance to the next pick by pressing the loom's pedal.

* Until you advance to the next pick, you may request a different jump (in case you got it wrong the first time) or cancel it.
  To cancel the jump you may do any of the following:

    * Press the "Reset" button to the right of "Jump".

    * Reload the page.

    * Select a new pattern.

## Repeating

The software will automatically repeat patterns if you weave or unweave beyond the end.
The exact behavior is controlled by the `Separate repeats` checkbox:

* "On" (checked): you must advance twice when you reach an end, before the next set of shafts is raised.
  The first advance will lower all shafts, as a signal that you have finished weaving or unweaving one pattern repeat. That is the "separator".

* "Off" (unchecked): there is no indication that you have reached the end of the pattern.
  The next pick will be pick 1 of the pattern, if weaving, or the last pick, if unweaving.

The default value of `Separate repeats` is "on" if the pattern has more than 20 picks, "off" otherwise.
The idea behind this is that frequent separator picks are annoying for short patterns, but having a separator pick is useful for long patterns.

[Threading](threading.md) has a checkbox with the same name that does the same basic thing.
However, the value of the Weaving and Threading `Separate repeats` checkboxes are independent of each other,
and may also be different for different patterns. They are saved in the pattern database.
