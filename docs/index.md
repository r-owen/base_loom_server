# Loom Server

A loom server allows you to control a computer-controlled loom from a web browser on a phone, tablet or computer.

Features include:

* Direct support for three types of weaving pattern files: WIF (.wif), Fiberworks (.dtx), and WeavePoint (.wpo).
* Support for weaving and threading.
* Settings to accommodate your preferences.
* Preliminary support for multiple languages (the translation files need work; [contributions welcome](translations.md)).
* Runs on all major operating systems.
* The software is free and uses the generous MIT license.

I maintain software to control [Toika](https://pypi.org/project/toika-loom-server/)
and [Séguin](https://pypi.org/project/seguin-loom-server/) looms.
The base package [base_loom_server](https://pypi.org/project/base-loom-server/) does most of the work,
so it is easy to [support other looms](coding.md#writing-a-loom-server).

This document explains how to use these loom servers. 
The first step is to [install](installing.md) the software. Once you have done that, read on:

## Disable Automatic Sleep

You may wish to disable automatic sleep on your device, so it will stay awake while you are weaving.
If your device does go to sleep you can continue to weave, but you can't see what's going on.

The simplest solution is to just disable the sleep timer.
On iOS and macOS search for "Lock" in Settings.

On iOS another solution is to [use Guided Access](#using-guided-access-on-ios-to-prevent-display-sleep).
This requires a manual step every time you start weaving, but allows you to use the normal sleep timer the rest of the time.

Note: there is a standard web API for disabling sleep, but it requires a secure https connection.
Unfortunately https is not very practical for a device such as a loom which may not be connected to the internet,
and so cannot reliably renew its certificate.

## Connect to the Loom Server

Connect to the loom server using any modern web browser (e.g. on a phone, tablet, or laptop).
The address will be "http://*hostname*.local:8000" where *hostname* is the host name
of the loom server computer, as determined in [Installing](installing.md).

If you are running the web browser and web server on the same computer, you can skip the hostname and connect to "http://localhost:8000".

## Select the Mode

The server has three modes, which are listed at the top of the web page:

* [Weaving](weaving.md) is used to weave fabric; this is by far the most common mode.

* [Threading](threading.md) helps you thread the loom, by lifting shafts for groups of threads.

* [Settings](settings.md) allows you specify settings that apply to all weaving pattern files.

Click on the word to select that mode.
The bold word shows the current mode.

The links above give detailed instructions for each mode.
But before you dive into that, read the next section about pattern files:

In addition, the "?" link on the same line as the mode tabs opens documentation in a new browser tab.

## Upload and Select Pattern Files

Before you can weave or thread, you must upload one or more pattern files to the loom server.
The server accepts WIF (.wif), Fiberworks (.dtx), and WeavePoint (.wpo) files.

There are two ways to upload files:

* Push the "Upload" button.
* Drag and drop the files onto the web page (making sure the web page is gray before dropping them).

Once you have uploaded patterns, you can select one using the menu labeled "Pattern" (next to the "Upload" button).

The loom server remembers the 25 most recent patterns that you have uploaded,
and this information is saved on disk, so should not be lost in a power failure.

The saved information includes the most recent pick (weaving) and the most recent warp thread group (threading).
This allows you to switch between different patterns while weaving someth
ing.
However, if you upload a new pattern with the same file name as a saved pattern,
the new pattern overwrites the old and the pick and warp thread group information is reset.
So please be careful.

To clear out the pattern menu (which may become cluttered over time),
select "Clear Recents", the last item in the pattern menu.
This clears out information for all patterns except the current pattern.

## Multiple Connections

The server only allows one web browser to connect, and the most recent connection wins.
This prevents a mystery connection from hogging the loom.
If the connection is dropped on the device you want to use for weaving,
simply reload the page to regain the connection.

## Reset the Loom Connection

Every time you reload the web page or connect from a different device, the server refreshes its connection to the loom (by disconnecting and immediately reconnecting).

If the server is reporting a problem with its connection to the loom,
and it is not due to the loom losing power, or a disconnected or bad USB cable,
you might try reloading the page.

If the loom seems confused, try turning off the loom, waiting a few seconds, then turning it on again.
Then reload the web page, to force the web server to make a new connection to the loom.

## Using Guided Access on iOS to Prevent Sleep

Directions for using Guided Access on iOS to prevent your device from going to sleep.

> *Warning*: Guided Access disables all notifications while in use.

Configure Guided Aceess. You just need to do this once:

* Turn on Guided Access in Settings:

    * In Settings search for Guided Access, which is in Accessibility.
    * Enable it by turning on the button labeled "Guided Access".
    * Under Passcode Settings enable Face ID, to simplify getting out of this mode.
    * Set "Display Auto-Lock" to Never.
    * Add Guided Access control to the control center as follows:

* Add a control to turn on Guided Access to the Control Center:

    * Bring up the control center by dragging down from the upper right-hand corner.
    * Press the "+" at the top left edge of the control center.
    * Click "Add a Control" at the bottom of the control center.
    * Search for Guided Access and add it.

Then, whenever you start weaving, open the web browser, then bring up the control center to enter Guided Access.
When you are done weaving, double-click the power button to disable Guided Access.
